# Use this changelog template to create an entry for release notes.

# One of 'breaking', 'deprecation', 'new_component', 'enhancement', 'bug_fix'
change_type: enhancement

# The name of the component, or a single word describing the area of concern, (e.g. filelogreceiver)
component: loadbalancerexporter

# A brief description of the change.  Surround your text with quotes ("") if it needs to start with a backtick (`).
note: Refactors how the load balancing exporter splits metrics

# Mandatory: One or more tracking issues related to the change. You can use the PR number here if no issue exists.
issues: [32513]

# (Optional) One or more lines of additional information to render under the primary note.
# These lines will be padded with 2 spaces and then inserted directly into the document.
# Use pipe (|) for multiline entries.
subtext: All splitting is *behaviorally*, the same. However, the `resource` routingID now uses the `internal/exp/metrics/identity` package to generate the load balancing key, instead of bespoke code. This means that when upgrading to this version your routes for specific metric groupings could change. However, this will be stable and all future metrics will follow the new routing

# If your change doesn't affect end users or the exported elements of any package,
# you should instead start your pull request title with [chore] or use the "Skip Changelog" label.
# Optional: The change log or logs in which this entry should be included.
# e.g. '[user]' or '[user, api]'
# Include 'user' if the change is relevant to end users.
# Include 'api' if there is a change to a library API.
# Default: '[user]'
change_logs: [user]
